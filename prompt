### Mode

You are working in **Hardcoded Data Mode**.
**DO NOT** connect to a database, ORM, or backend.

All data must be:

* stored in local TypeScript files
* treated as mock data
* easily replaceable later with Drizzle + PostgreSQL

---

## Data Source Rules (MANDATORY)

1. Create a file:

```
/src/data/mockLibrary.ts
```

2. Export **plain TypeScript objects only**
3. No async calls
4. No API routes
5. No persistence (no localStorage)

---

## Data Models (STRICT)

```ts
export type ReadingStatus =
  | "wishlist"
  | "owned"
  | "reading"
  | "paused"
  | "finished"
  | "abandoned";

export interface Book {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  author?: string;
  coverUrl?: string;
  description?: string;
}

export interface LibraryBook {
  id: string;
  bookId: string;
  status: ReadingStatus;
  owned: boolean;
  priority: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  rating?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  hooked: boolean;
  notes?: string;
  startedAt?: string;
  finishedAt?: string;
}
```

---

## Mock Data Requirements

### Books

Create **at least 8–10 books** with:

* mixed authors
* realistic titles
* at least 2 books without ownership

### Library Entries

Create **1 library entry per book**, with:

* different statuses
* at least:

  * 2 `wishlist`
  * 2 `reading`
  * 2 `finished`
  * 1 `paused`
  * 1 `abandoned`

---

## Example Mock Data Structure

```ts
export const books: Book[] = [
  {
    id: "b1",
    title: "White Nights",
    author: "Fyodor Dostoevsky",
    coverUrl: "/books/white-nights.jpg",
  },
  ...
];

export const libraryBooks: LibraryBook[] = [
  {
    id: "l1",
    bookId: "b1",
    status: "finished",
    owned: true,
    priority: 3,
    rating: 5,
    hooked: true,
    finishedAt: "2025-01-10",
  },
  ...
];
```

---

## State Management Rules

* Use **React `useState` only**
* Treat data as **read-only**
* Simulate updates by:

  * copying arrays
  * updating state locally
* No mutations to original mock file

---

## UI Logic Rules

* Combine data via:

```ts
const book = books.find(b => b.id === libraryBook.bookId);
```

* Filters must work exactly as final app:

  * by status
  * by owned
  * by priority
  * by rating

---

## UX Constraints (Must Enforce)

* Max **2 books** can have status `"reading"`
* Cannot rate books unless status is `"finished"`
* Wishlist books must have `owned = false`
* Finished books must show `finishedAt`

If rules are violated:

* show UI error state
* do not update state

---

## File Structure Guidance

```
src/
 ├─ data/
 │   └─ mockLibrary.ts
 ├─ components/
 │   ├─ BookCard.tsx
 │   ├─ StatusBadge.tsx
 │   └─ RatingStars.tsx
 ├─ pages/
 │   ├─ Dashboard.tsx
 │   ├─ Library.tsx
 │   └─ Wishlist.tsx
```

---

## Migration Promise (IMPORTANT)

All mock data and logic must be written in a way that:

* can be replaced later by TanStack Query
* can be mapped 1:1 to Drizzle schema
* does not leak mock-specific logic into UI components
